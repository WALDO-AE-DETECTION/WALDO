**Waldo** is an open-source automated machine learning tool designed to detect Adverse Events (AEs) from unstructured text, such as social media reports on cannabis-derived products. Developed using RoBERTa, the tool helps pharmacovigilance efforts by automating the detection of rare events.

## Features
- üå± Classifies social media narratives for potential AEs
- üíª Fine-tuned **RoBERTa** model with 99.66% accuracy
- üìä Outputs results in an easy-to-analyze CSV format
- üöÄ Open-source and easy to integrate into existing workflows

## Study & Research
This project is part of a collaborative study involving researchers from Johns Hopkins University, University of Michigan, and other institutions. The full paper will be linked here upon publication.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iMvijay23/Waldo-AE-Detection.git
cd Waldo-AE-Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the package directly:

```bash
pip install .
```

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Usage

Run the classifier from the command line:

```bash
ae-classifier --input path/to/input.csv --output path/to/output.csv
```

### Input File Format
The input file should be a CSV with the following columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each comment
- `comment`: The text to be classified

### Output File Format
The output file will contain:
- `id`: The original ID
- `comment`: The original comment
- `ae_label`: 'yes' or 'no' indicating the presence of an AE
