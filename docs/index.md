Welcome to the official website of **Waldo**, a cutting-edge open-source tool for automated detection of Adverse Events (AEs) in unstructured text data. Waldo is designed to assist researchers and healthcare professionals in identifying potential adverse events, such as side effects or complications, from real-world narratives like social media posts.

## About the Project

**Waldo** leverages a fine-tuned RoBERTa model, capable of processing large volumes of unstructured text data, such as online reviews, forum discussions, and self-reported experiences, to detect potential AEs related to cannabis-derived products. The tool automates the traditionally labor-intensive process of adverse event reporting, making it easier to spot rare events that could otherwise go unnoticed.

With an impressive **accuracy of 99.66%**, Waldo has shown to be an invaluable asset in pharmacovigilance efforts, providing reliable and scalable AE detection.

### Why Waldo?

- üåü **High Accuracy**: Achieves 99.66% accuracy in AE detection, outperforming many traditional methods.
- üìÑ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Processes and analyzes unstructured text data from diverse sources, including social media, blogs, and medical forums.
- üöÄ **Easy to Use**: Waldo integrates seamlessly into your existing workflows, providing fast and reliable results.
- üîß **Customizable**: As an open-source tool, Waldo is fully customizable to meet specific research needs and can be extended or fine-tuned with additional datasets.

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy (99.66%)** in detecting adverse events from unstructured text.
- **Processes unstructured data** from sources such as social media and medical forums.
- **Open-source**: Free to use, customize, and contribute to.
- **Streamlined integration**: Easily integrates into workflows, whether for research or industry.
